# Metronome

This is a personal project that I made using Arduino back in the summer of 2024, which uses an Arduino Uno R3 board that is wired to the circuit and is programmed in the C++ language with the Arduino IDE. The aim of this was to make a simple metronome implementing an LCD display screen to show the metronome marking. The user of this metronome can change the pulse of each repetitive beat by dialing the potentiometer to any tempo between 60 bpm and 500 bpm. The circuit also uses a I2C module which made wiring the LCD screen to the Uno R3 board much easier, as well as a LED to blink during each beat and a button to toggle the metronome on and off.
